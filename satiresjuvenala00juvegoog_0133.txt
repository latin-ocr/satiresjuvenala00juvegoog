long to be fluished in one or two recitatione. Hence toties. As re-
gards the form renes, compare that of the AEneia of Virgil—
Oodri. We have retained here the ordinary reading. Jahnend
others, however, give Oords', which-is certainly the usual Latinih'rn'r'3 '

bot the MSS. are against it. Perhaps the same individual is meant
who is alluded to in Sat. iii, 184.

. Togatae. “His comedies.'’ Supply fabulas. In the fobet-
la ator the plot and characters were Romen, the name being de·
rived from the toyu, or main article oi Roman attire. In thepollr'ntoe,
so called from the Greek palliam, the plot and characters were Gre-
cian. The pretextato were not so much tragedias es historica]
plays-Eleyoa. “His love-sich ditties.'’ Literally, “his elegias.”
The alepi were small poems on moornful or tender subjecte, in alter·
nate hexameters arrd pentameters.-Inyens Telephe. “Bnlky Te-
lephus.” Some prolix and stupid play, having for its subject the
well-known legend ol Telephus, king of Mysia, who was wounded by

“Or Orestes, the margin of the manuscript already full to the very
edge, written also on the beck,” dno. Another almost interminable

wrote on only one side of the paper or parchment, leaving a margin
more or less broad. When they wrote also on the back, as in the
present instance, the works were called Oputhopripli, and were said
to bewritteu “aoerm churtu.” Ι

7-8. Quam miti. Because these themes have been so incessantly .
dinned into his ears-Dacus Martis. We have our choice here ol
three locelities: either the grove secred to Mars, near Alba, where
Rhea Silvia brought forth Romulus arrd Remus3 or a grone of Mars
ou the Applan Way, where, accordingto the old scholiast, poets were
accustomed to recite; or the grove oi this same deity iu Colchis,
from an oalr in which the golden fleece was suspended. Heinrich
declares in favor ol the last; bnt the first is most probable‚ ee being
a strictly nadonul theme, connected with the legend ol the origin of
Rome-AEolir's cidnum mpibsoe munem, dc. By the “ AEoliun rocks”
are meant the Liperi Islands, in one of which AEolus reigned. The
‘⁴ cave of Vulcan” is the adjacent AEtna, not, as some think, the isl-
and ol Hiera (now Volcano), one of the Lipari group. ¹

9-11. Quid ayant venti. “What the winde may be doing.” Al·
