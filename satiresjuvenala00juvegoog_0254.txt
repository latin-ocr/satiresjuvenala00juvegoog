SATIRE X.

ARGUMENOE

'l'he subject oi this inimitable satire is the vanity ot human
wishes. From the prinoipal events in the lives of the most illustri·
ous characters of all eges, the poet shows bow little happiness is
promoted by the attainment oi what our indistinot aud limited
views represent as the greatest of earthly blessings. Of these he
instances wealth, power, eloquente, military glory, longevity, and
personal accomplishments, all ol which he shows have proved dan-
gerous or destructive to their respective possessore. Hence he ar-
gues the wisdom of acquiescing in the dispensations of Heaven3
and concludes with a form of prayer, in which he points cut, with¹
great force and beauty, the objecta for which a rational being may
prcsnme to approach the Almighty. There is a celebrated imita·
tion ol this poenr by Dr. Johnson. (Erunt.)

1-6. Gadibus. Gades (now Ouda'z) is here regarded as the western Ι

limit of the earth. It stood cn a small island, separated from the
main land by a narrew channel. It was a colony ef the Phoeni-
cians, and their chief commercial settlement outside the Pillars of
Hercules. Its Phoenician name was Gaddir, “a fortified inclosure.”
-Usqeodurorana “ Even to the farthest east.'’ Aurora had her
abode in the farthest eust, and came forth in the dawn of morning
from the eastern Oceanus. Observa that esque without ad, except
in the names ol cities, is of rare occurrence even in 'the poete.-
Dr'quoscere. “To discriminate between.''-Remolu erroris nebula.
“The mist of error being removed from the mental news-Ratione.
“With reason ae our guide,” i. e, on rational grounds-Quid tam
dextro pede canapis. “What do you so auspiciously enter upon” ¹
Observc that dextro pede is forsas-ete pede, i. e, feliciter orsurus.—
Ut te nou poerritear. “That yon will not, in all likelihood, repent of.”
Observc the force of the subjunctive-Peraea. “Accomplished.”'
7-15. optantibus ipsis. “Themselves desiring it,’' i. a, they pray
for what, when granted, involves their own ruin.-Disocr'las. “The
too easy gode,” i. e, turning too ready and indulgent an ear to the
foelish prayers of their veturiae-Nocitura. “calculated to harm.”
—Topa ‘⁶ In the robe of peace,” ie, in civil life-Multis. As,
lor instance, to Demosthenes, Cicero, dcc-Ille. Milo of Crotona,
the celebrated athlete. There were different accounts of his death.
