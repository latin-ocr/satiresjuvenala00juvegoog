After ¹enumereting with great humour the animal and vegetahle
gods of the Egyptians, the author directe his powerful ridicule at
their sottish and'ferocious bigotry, of which he gives an atrocioris
end loethsome example. The conclusion of the Satire, which is a
just and beautiful description of the origin of civil society (infinite-
ly superior to any thing thet Lucretius or Horace has delivered on
the subject), founded, not on natural instinct, but on principles of
¹ mutual benevolence implented by Deity in the breast of mun, ancl

of man alone, does honour to the genius, good sense, and enlight·
ened morality of the author. (Erana.)
