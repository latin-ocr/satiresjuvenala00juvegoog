Nonus ΟΝ SAT. 1. 123

“ “Th'e venom of tho toad.” Rohetu is the animal itself put for the '¹

, renum which it wne supposed to produce. There is great doubt,
however, whether tho toad is actually meent hero. Somesuppose
the reference to be made to the rona rubeta, a species of frog found
in brushwood (rubras), much used in megic end in poiseus. Its
blood, according to AElian (N. A, xvii, 12), when mixed with wine,
often produced instant death. Others, however, make the rubeta to
be the same with the Bofo cornutus, e horned frog. The Greek
term is φρῦνος. (Adime, so.)¹ ’ ’ ”

for her skill in concocting poisons. Throngh her meane, Agrippina

to come into notice'at Rome, commit some act of great rnscality,
which ought to con'sign you to banishment or α, prison, but which et
Rome will prove the most effectuel means of making you wealthy

vourites of bad emperors, who were wont to enrich end advance
themselves by acts which ought to have subjected'them to the se-
'verest punishment-'Brevibto Gyaris dignum( “ Worthy of nerrow
