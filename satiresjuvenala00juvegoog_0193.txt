Ne toto adulatrix, fic. “Leat by this time tha whole adudag
crowd may have completed their round,”i e, lest ha may be too

. late for tha time of morning leree. The text does not mean that

clienta waited upon several patrous in succession, which would ho
vdirectly contrary to Roman custom‚ but that clienta were accuntom-
ed to po round, each to his particular patron. These visits com·
bined form what is here called orbern. Compare Lucios, Ni, stc,
22: περιθέοντες iv κύκλῳ τὴν retia-Sideribus dubiis. “When the
stara are now beginning ιο fade.’' This is intended to math every
early period of the morning-Aet illc tempore, fic. ‘⁴ Or else, at

’ ,This marks a somewhat later period of tha morning, though still
quite early, when the other atara hare disappeared, and only the
most northern constellatione are still seen moring monnd. In the
langnage of poetry, the other stars hare sunk beneath the ocean,
but Bootes and the two Bears, inasmnch as they never sink below
our horizon, still appear in the hearers, martring, therefore, the pe-
riod immediately preceding the dawn. Compare Statius, Theb, iii,
683, εοᾳ.-Γηζφ“ᾱο. Because ao near tha north pols-Sarraca

The constellation of Bootes (“ the herdsman”) is frequently called
Arctophylax‘(“ the guard of the bear”).

atta Quod sadda nolit, lac. Which wool just ahorn will refrte
to imbibo,” i. a, too thick and worthlces to be used even for wash-
ing out the greeae from newly-shorn wool. Compare Varro, R, R„
11,, 11, 6. This is the common way of explaining the words of the
text. It is better, however, to regard them aa referring to the med- ”
ical practice of antiquity, in which t‘reshly-shorn wool was laid npon
wonnds after having been made to imbibe oil, or vinegan or wine,
according as a soothing or stimulating effect was sought to he ob·
tained. Compare Celsos, viii, 3.—De conviva Corybanta ridebis.
