notras¹ ow ιιι. v111. 213

6-9. Generis tabula. A genealogical table is meant. The Romm
nobles ιιι these in addition to the stemmata. Schneider (ad Vinum,
vol. ii, p. 458) thinks that ιιι reference here is to ιιι tablinum, ιι
apartment immediately adjoiniug the atrium, and in which the tam-
ily archites were kept. But the epithet capaci is opposed to this.-
Corae'rmm mailoc, dec. Several MSS. omit this verse. It certainly
cannot have followed upon verse ιιι, for two reasons: first, he-
cause Corvinus has been mentioned just before; and, secondly, ha
cause the genealogical table ιιιι not he cepas to contain merely a
single ιιιιι. (Meyer, adloa.)-Multa matinpere uirga. “To reach
ιιιιι marelling along many a branch,” i. a, along many a daea or
rannus, connecting together the different imagines. We would say,
'along many a branch of the genealogica] trae. This is certainly ιιι
most natural explanation. The scholiast, however, makes multa
uirpa equivalent to multis fascibum while Κ. F. Hermann thinks
that virga means the rod which the noble lord holds, and with which
ιι points to (manmit) the images of his ancestors. He aleo retains
werse f, bat strikes out verses mh and ιιι. (Rbeiu. Mun, 1848,
p. lbi, sema-Famem. “All dingywith smoke,” ie, from ιιι Ι
atrium. This, of course, would he an indication of high antiquity.
-Sa' coram lepidis male visitur. “If one leuda an evil lita under
ιιι very eyes of the Lepidi.” A noble family of ιιι AEmilian
gens. He means in ιιι presence of their imagines.

9-15. Quo. Supply pertinent. “Whither ιιιι,” aa, of what

Lucifer or Phosphorus in the morning-Durus. ‘⁴ Those leaders of

shall Fabius, though born in an Herculeam home, plume himself on
