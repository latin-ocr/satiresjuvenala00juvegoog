is required, but the buoket can be dipped at once into the well, a
matter of no little importance in a country where so much watering
was wanted as in Italy.- Vive &denas amans. Here pass your days

agoream, in general, abstained from animal food, owing to their
belief, it is seid, in the metempsychosis, and observed a vegetable
diet. Such, at least, is the common account, and the one followed

to have bed-chambers remote from tho noise in the streete. They,
therefore, who would slecp at Rome, must be at great expense, which
