it is established that Juvenal was alive at least seven-
teen years after the death of Paris, and that some of

his Satires were composed after the death of Domi· Ι

tien. .

The only facts with regard to Juvenal upon which
we can implicitly rely are, that he flourished toward
the close of the'first century3 that Aquinum, if n'ot
the place of his nativity‚ was at least his chosen res·
idence3 and that he is, in all probability, the friend

whom Martial addresses inthree epigrama. There is ΙΙ

perhaps another circumstance which we may admit.

We are told that he declaimed for many years of his ⁴

life, and every page in his writings bears evidence to
the accuraoy of this assertion. Every piece is a fin·
ishad rhetorical essny, energctie, glowing, and sono·
rous. He denounces vice in the most indignant terms3

.’ but the obvious 'tone of exaggeration which pervadas,
all his iniectives leaves us in doubt how far this sus-
tained passion is real, and how far assumed for mere
show. The extant works cf Juvenal consist of six-
teen Satires, the last-being a fragment of doubtful au-
thenticity‚ all composed in heroic hexametcrs. Ι
