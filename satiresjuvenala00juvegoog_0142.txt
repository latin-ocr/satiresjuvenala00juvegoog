to mark the contrast between the sizo of the basket end the rich
petron’s supper of seven secolo. The Romans, in the days oi free-
dom, entertained their cliente, alter the latter had attended them in
public, at a supper, which was called corna recta. But, aster the ex·
tinction of liberty, when the cliente had lost all political indemnes,
instead of being regularly entertained, they merely received a por-

their own homes. Iler the sake of convenience, it soon became cus-
tomary to give en equivalent iri money, the sum established by gena
