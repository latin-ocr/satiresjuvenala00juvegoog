philosophy.” Some render this, “ Pass by their gymnasia‚” i. a, let
us say nothing of their schools of exercise, and of the ordinary herd
of Greeks, whom these may be said to represent, but let us turn ιο
a graver crime. This explanation, however, has very little, if auy
thing, to recommend it-Factme majoris abolla “A crime of the
larger cloak,” i. a, a crime committed by oue of their philosophers
himself. The ordinary ubeda was a kind oi short cloak, not differ·
ing materially from the sapum, and fasteued by a brooch under the
neck or upon the top of the shoulder. It was originally worn'by
the military, but subsequently by all classes. The rnnjor aeota,
however, was a species of large cloak, or wrapper, wem more espe-
cially by philosophers, and hence is here taken figuratively for the

philosopher himself, the germont for the person who wore it.--Sto-
icus. P. Egnatius Celer is meant, a follower of the Stoic sect in

the'time of Nero, who gave false evidence against Bareas Soranus,
a most exemplary man, upon which the latter was eapitally con-
victed. Egnatius received large rewardsfrom the emperor. What
made the conduct of Egnatius the more atrocioua was, that he be-
longed to a sect which prided itself on its striet code'of morale, and
tha't he had been the client, and intimate friend, and philosophie
teacher of his viatim-Occidit. “Killed‚” i. a, by his false accu-
satiens-Disaputamque. Ritter (Philobqas, v. 567, seq.) conjec-
tures Discipalrrmqec, making the reference to be, not to Soranus, but¹
to his daughter Servilia, who was put ιο death with her parent.-
Ripa amatas in illa, de. “Though reared on that bank,” de, i. a,
though reared in the philosophie schools of Tarsus. 'ibe allusion
is to the bank of the River Cydnus, in Cilicia, where stood the city
'of Tarsus, famed for its schoah of philosophy. According to the le-
gend, the winged horse Pegasus lost a hoof (ταρσός) here, whence the
name of the city. Juvenal, following a different account from the
ordinary oue, makes Pegasus to have dropped here a “ wing-feath-
er” merely. Commentators find a great difficulty here, becauaeDio
Cassius makes Egnatius to have been a native of Berytus, in Phoe-
nicia, not of Tarsus; and hence, iu order to reconcile J uvenal’s ac-
count with that of the legend respecting the origin of this letter city,
they make ripa inibe text embraee the idea oi the whole coast of ,
southern Asia Minor andPhoeniciat Others, again, suppose the
poet to be speaking, not of Tarsus, but of Thebes or of Corinth.
The whole difficulty disappears, however, if we only bear in mind
that nutrires does not necessarily imply natus, and that Egnatius,
though born at Berytus, might very well have been reared aud edu-
ceted at Tarsus.
