is here contemptuously applied to Crispinus instead of “ courtier.”
-Magni paleati. Some keep-sighted commentatore deteet a pun
hera-Princepseqaitayn. “Tne leading man in the equestrian or-
der,” i. a, in consequence of his wealth. Crispinus was also prefect
of the Praetorian guard, an office generally filled at this time by a
person of equestrian rank. We must not, however, eonfound the
title of Princeps Equitum with that of Princeps Javentutis. This lat-
ter was given to the probable successor to the throne.

Magna qui voce solebat, dac. “Who erst was went in lond accepts
to seli (about the streete), at retail, siluri from the same bomugh with
himself,'' i. a, from Canopus or Alexandrea. The silurus (Sabella

Multas) was a speeies of enred fish imparted from Egypt, and =

. forming a common and cheap article of iood for the lower orders.
Crispinus originally was a hawlrer of these. 'I'here is considerable
doubt about the true reading here. We have adhered, with Jahn,t0
that of the MSS, which makes a very good sense. Some, however,
read fricta de nrerce, “from his stock of enred-fieb ;'' others, pacta
maceda, “ at fixed hire,'' ι’. e., for fixedor regular weges, thus malr-
ing Crispinus a hired hawker, not even the fish belonging to him3
and others, again, give Pharia de merce, “from his Egyptian stoek.”
All, these emendations, though ingenious, are quite unnecessary.
The reference is simply to selling by retail.

33-35. Incipe OuHiope. A burlesque imitation of the usual mode
of invcking the Muses at the commencement of an apic poem. Cal-
. liope ,represents the whole nine, because presiding over heroic po-
etry, and the most distinguished one of the aisterhood. Compare
Hesiod, Theop, 79, where Calliope is called προφερεστάτη ἁπασέων.
-Ia'cet et castam. “Yon may here even takeaseatss' Asubject
of so much importance will require all the attention· of the Muse,
and is not to be dispatched in a moment-Puella. The poet calls
these antiquated deitics young, just as in Lucian (Icaromenipp, 28)
the question is sportirely started why Apollo, though so very old,
has no heard: πῶς ἐν τοσούτῳ χρόνῳ ὀ Ἀπόλλων οὐ φύει πώγωνα.

36-43. Semianimem. Tabe pronouneed here sem'ant‘mam for the
sake ,of the metra-rFIoviaraltimas. “The last Flavius,”¹ i. a, Do-
mitian, the last of the Flavian line. Tbe Florian family, was one
of no distinction'before Vespasiap’s time. The emperorsof this
line were Vespasian, Titus, and Domitiam- Calvo Neroni. “A
bald-headed Ner0,'’ i. a, a second Nero, ay, aud a bald one too,
Baldness was a very sore subject with Domitian, and was regarded
as nnsightly by tho Romans generally. On the stage it was one of
the distinguishing characteristies cf parasites and other ridiculous
