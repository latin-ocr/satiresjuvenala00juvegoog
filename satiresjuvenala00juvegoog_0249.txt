224-230. Gmaoa principis. “Of a high-born prince.’' Ironical.
-Gaadeua sado, dc. “ Delighting to have his high rank prosti-

tnted by disgraceful singing on a foreign stage, and to have earned '

the parsley of the Grecisn crown.‘' We have adopted cantu, with
Jahn and Mayor, as preferable to saltu, the more common reading.
Nero was in Graece An). 67, into which year he crowded all the
Grocian gemes. He received no less than 1800 crowns, partly in
compliment, and partly for his so-called victorias at these games;
and on his return to Rome he entered the city in triumph, wearing
on his headan Olympio crown of wild olive, and bearing inhia
hand aPythian crown of hay, while he had the catalogue of his
victorias borne before him. Tha parsley crown mentioned in the
text had special reference tc the musical contests connected with
the Nemean gemes, in which games a erown of parsley was the
para-[mique. “The trophies.” Ironical. The Romans used to
hang their insignia around the pedestels of their ancestors’ statues,
or, if there were no statues, they appended them to the imagines in
the aratur-Domui. Domitius was the name of both the father and
grandfather of Nero. His father was Domitius Ahenobarbus, gov-
ernor of lhansslpine Gaul-sllyestoe. Vindex* also charged Nero
with appearing in this character (Ducat.‚1xin.‚a).—syrma.
“The long trailing robe.'' The syram (σύρμα) was a long robe,
trailing on the ground, more particularly worn upon the tragic stage
by actors who performed the'parts of divine or heroic personages.
It was intended to give grandeur and dignity to the person, and at
the same timeto conceal the unsightly appearance of the high-soled
omnigenerarum, at the back of the accos-Anapus. Nero
himself wrote a tragedy named Antigona—Personam Marallppcs.
“The mask of Melanippc.’' Melanippa, daughter of AEolns and
Eurydice, bore to Neptune twins, AEolus and Boeotus. Two of the
tragedias of Euripides bore her name—Et ale marmoreo, duc. Not
the colossal statne (120 feet high) of Nero himself, which stood in
tha vestibula of the podica lousa (Susa, Nar, 31), for this was of
brass, bnt most probably the statue of a Domitius. Some commen-
tatore, misled hy a passage in Suetonius'(Nar., 12), suppose the statue
of Augustus to he meant, but the reference there is to a crown, not
to the lyre itself. ,

nel-236. Tuis natalibus. “Thantbylineage.” Catilina was the
descendant of sn ancient patrician family, which had sunl( into pov-
erty. His great-grandfather and his great-great·grandfather both
bore the name of M. Sergius Silo, and were both distinguished men.

-Octlepi Cethegus also was descended from an old patrician lina.
