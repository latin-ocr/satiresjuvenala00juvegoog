rores ou sir. xvi. 305

' (verse 49), choose his own time; he must weit until, in the course

of the people's year, his turn may come. Actione between civilians
Ι (before the centumuiri) were heard in the order in which applicetion
hed been mede to the prator.

44-50. subsellia tantem sternantur. “libe benches alone are
spread with cushions‚’‘ i. e, are got ready. The benches of the
judges arc got ready, but the judges are not ready, and there is no
qnorum to commence business- Tam. While waiting for the ¹
judges to appear and open court-Faesardo ponente lacernas, &c
While the pleader Caedicius is laying aeide his lacerna, end pre-
paring ιο address the court (when it sh‘ull heve opened) in his toga.
The laeena was worn over the toga-Mummio. “ Obeying a call
of nature.”—Parati diffluum, dic. “Though prepared for the
fray, we part combnt, and fight in the dilatory lists of the lew.”
The civilian at length leaves the court-roem in despair, and the case

· stands again edomet-Tempus apendi. “A time for the hearing

of their case.” Literelly, “for pleading.”- Longo effamine litis.
“By the tedious drag-chain of litigation.”

51-60. Solis praetermito. A third privilege of soldiers. The
right of acquiring property independently of the father,'and also of
making ο will. A son who was ia triana patris had no property of
his own, strictly speaking. What he was allowed to enjoy as such
(termcd his peculiam) was halden e precarious tenure, and might·
be taken from him by his father. But in imperial timer this law
was relaxed in favour of the soldiery. A soldier, when arming for
battle, and even at ordinary times also, was allowed to name an
heir in the presence of three or four witnesses.-Non esse in corpore
renate. “ Should not be incorporated in the private fortune.’'-
AEra nuenton. “Eaming the pay.''-Tremalae. “'l'rembling
with age.”-Captot. “Pays court to.’' 'llic fatherturns inherit-
auce-hunter to his own som-Fauor oeqaee, fec. Τιο idaeis,
Coranus is advanced by ‘⁶ well-merited fpvour‚’' end his honourable
exertions are crowned by the fitting reward. At least, it appears
to concern the commender himself that his brevest soldiors ιο most
quickly advanoed, that ailbe gladdened by badges of distinction.
(Meyer, ad loc.) The common text has labor oeqeee, but labor fol· ,
lowed by labori in the next line makes an exceedingly harsh cou-
strnction. We have therefore substitutedsaeor with Ruperti, Jahn,
and Mayor. '
