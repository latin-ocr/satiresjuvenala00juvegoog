Erpedcr quid coaoedctur, dcc. Concluding remark of the poet.
Since it is dangorous, then, to attach the living, I will try how rar
it may be allowed me to satirize the dead. The poet, however, only
adhmes to this determination in appearance, since he still continues
to attack the power-ful, but does it ander fictitious names-Qantara
Memmiadae. Tha lawe of the Twelva'fables forbade all burials
within the city. Places for barini, therefore, were usually by the
sides of the great reads leading to Rome, and on some of these
roads the tombs formed an almost uninterrupted street for many
miles from the gates of the city—Latina The Flaminiar Way
has already been mentioned. The Latin Way led from Romo to
Bepeventum.

ARGUMENT.

Umbritius, an aruspex, and friend of the author, disgnstad attha
prevalence of vioe aad the disregard of unassuming virtue, is on the
point of quittiug Rome; and, when a little way from the city, stopa
short to acquaint the poet, who has accompanied him, with the
causes of his retirement. These may be arranged under the fol-
lowing heads': That Irlsttery and Vico are the only thriring arts at
Rome. · In these, especiallythe first, foreigners have a manifest ad· ·
vantage over the nativas, and, consequentiy, engross all favour: that
the poor are universally exposed to sccrn and insultr that the geis-
eral habits of extravaganoe render it difficult for them to subsistr
that the want of a well-regulated police subjecte thern to number-
less miserias and inconveniences, aggravated by the crowded stata
of the capital, from all which a country life is happily free3 and on
the tranquillity aad security of this last he dilates with great beauty.
