“stupes-with its upper leather burst.”-Vel si consuto, dcc. The
poet’s language here is-humorously metaphorical. By valuere is
meant the rupture of the ahoe, and by cicatrix the awkward “ seam”
on the cobhled putch, exhibiting to wiew the coarse thread in the
new-made stanes-Inquit. “Exclaims the superintendentes
scats.” Supply designator. This iunctionary was somewhut like
the modern door-keeper of a theatre. Every seat was numbsred,
the space allotted to each being marked by aliua drawn on each -
siderof it, and the billet of admission (tessera theatralis) specified
the number of the seat which the person was to occupy‚ and which
was shown to him hy the designator when he entered the theatro.—
Pulvino mueatri In Be. 68, the tribune L. Roscius Otho carried
a lew-which regulated the places in the theatre to be occupied hy
the different classes of Roman citizens, aud which enacted‚ in par-
ticular, thet fourteen rows of benches should be assigned to the
equestrian ordea-myas rec leyi, de. The amount of an equestri-
an fortune was 400,000 sesterces, and a person not having this was
excluded from the fourteen rows. Bankrupts lost their scats.
Many ¹persons, moreover, belonging to the equites, whose estates
were impeired, feared to take their scats, until Augustus ordained
that no eques, whose father or himself had at any time ¹possessed
400,000 sesterces, should he liable to the penalties of the law.

crier.’'-Iuter pinnirapi mdosjuveucs, &a “Amid the smarly-dress-

The term pinnirapus properly means any gladiator matohed with a
Samnite or Thracian, each of whom wore feathers (piune) in their
helmets, which it was the object of their opponent to “snatch away.''
Ι ¹ Hence the name given them, from pinna and rapta—Lanutae. The
lanista was the keeper of a gladiatorial school—Sic libitum vano, &a
According to Umbritius, the law of Otho was prompted by mere
capriceon the part of a v'ain and frivolous man-Qui nos disum.
