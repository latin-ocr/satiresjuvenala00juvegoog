on the right bank oi the Nile, in Upper Egypt, or Thebais-Tenty-
ra. Now Dcaderat, in Upper Egypt, on the left bank of the Nile,
and capital of the Tentyritio nome. As Ombi and Tentyra were
separated by seversl importent effice, they were not, strictly speck-
ing, finiani,- it seems more probable thet Juvenal uses this term
somewhat laxly‚ then thot he was misteken as to the locelity of
either city. Relativoly to the Romans, any two towns in the sume
district might be called neighbours. ’
